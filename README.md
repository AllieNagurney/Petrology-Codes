# Petrology-Codes

The files in here contain Python codes that can be utilized to simplify plotting of various data for metamorphic petrologists.

Plotting Garnet Traverses in Python
This file allows you to take an excel document that contains a major element (X alm, X prp, X sps, X grs) traverse across a garnet crystal and plot it in  Python. 
Example Data = example formatted Excel file for this code. 

2D Plotting of Perple_X Outputs
The 2018PPGrt_01 python file allows for the easy plotting of 2D werami data from PerpleX. The input files are garnet_comp.tab and garnet_staurolite_volume.tab. There is a lot of flexibilty to change the 2D heat maps to make them more beneficial for the user. The data here has been published in Nagurney, A.B., Caddick, M.J., White, C.E., (2022) Garnet crystallization mechanisms and localized polymetamorphism in the southwestern Meguma Terrane, Nova Scotia, Canada.
